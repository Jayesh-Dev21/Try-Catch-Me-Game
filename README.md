# The Try Catch Me


Welcome to **Try-Catch-Me**! 🎤  
We have rebranded, revamped, and reloaded! Gone are the days of games—now, we’re all about **programmer jokes** and humor. If you’re a coder, debugger, or someone who just loves cringing at puns, this website is for you.

Just for fun, no pun intended 😂😂

## 🚀 Project Overview

_"Don't Skip Me."_ — Yes, seriously, **don’t skip this website**. While it’s no longer a game, **Try-Catch-Me** is now a treasure trove of jokes that only programmers will understand. You’ll laugh, you’ll groan, and you might even type `rm -rf /*` just to make it stop (but please don’t).

### **Why "Try-Catch-Me"?**

- Because exceptions deserve to be handled with humor.  
- It's a subtle nod to _“Don’t Click Me” websites_—you know, the ones that make you curious enough to click anyway.  
- And no, it’s not malware, but if it were, it’d probably be hilarious malware.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This project is a mix of essentials that make it clean, simple, and easy to laugh at:

### Frontend
- **HTML (32.5%)**: The foundation of our humor delivery system.  
  Fun Fact: Without HTML, this site would just be a bad knock-knock joke with no one to answer the door.

- **CSS (34.1%)**: The reason why the website looks great while delivering terrible puns.  
  CSS is like a stand-up comedian—it’s all about the presentation.

- **JavaScript (1.3%)**: Adds interactivity and ensures you get the punchline right when you least expect it.  
  Think of it as the heckler in the audience who makes the show even better.

### Backend
- **Python (31.1%)**: The engine behind all the joke-fetching and dynamic content.  
  Python is like the chill coder who just gets things done while making sarcastic comments.

- **Procfile (1%)**: For Heroku deployment, because even jokes need a reliable home.  
  It’s like the landlord of the website, making sure everything stays up and running.
